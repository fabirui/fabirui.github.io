About Me 

My name is Fabi√°n Cruz-Ruiz, I'm a first-generation Business Analytics master's student at the University of California, Irvine! My studies have allowed me to learn new skills related to machine learning, predictive analytics, statistics, and a wide range of programming lanaguges. Outside of school, I enjoy baking, trying new cafes, etc...




```{python}

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import random

# Random data
x = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
y = np.random.randint(1, 10, size=5)

# Random colors for each bar
colors = [random.choice(['#FF6347', '#6A5ACD', '#32CD32', '#FFD700', '#FF1493']) for _ in range(len(x))]

# Plot the graph
plt.bar(x, y, color=colors)

# Labels and title
plt.xlabel('Categories')
plt.ylabel('Values')
plt.title('Random Data Bar Graph')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
